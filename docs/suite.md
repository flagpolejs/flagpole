# Suite

A Suite is essentially a collection of test Scenarios. You will be able to choose which suite or suites you want to run, so it's important to think how you want to group them.

The best way to create a suite is with the default Flagpole function, which you can call `flagpole` by importing like this:

```typescript
import flagpole from "flagpole";
```

Then to create a new suite just use that as a function like this:

```javascript
const suite = flagpole("The title of my suite");
```

## Methods

### afterAll(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after all Scenarios finish executing.

```javascript
suite.afterAll((suite) => {});
```

### afterEach(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after each Scenario finishes executing.

```javascript
suite.afterEach((scenario) => {});
```

### base(parms: string | {} | Function): Suite

Set the base URL that all Scenarios in this Suite will use as its starting point.

This can be just a string:

```javascript
suite.base("https://www.google.com/");
```

Or it can be an object with environment as its key and the domain as its value.

```javascript
suite.base({
  prod: 'https://www.google.com/',
  stag: 'http://www.google.internal/'
  dev: 'http://www.google.local/'
})
```

Or it can be a callback function

```javascript
suite.base((suite) => {
  if (suite.executionOptions.environment == "prod") {
    return "https://www.google.com/";
  } else {
    return "http://www.google.internal/";
  }
});
```

### beforeAll(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback before the first Scenario starts executing.

```javascript
suite.beforeAll((suite) => {});
```

### beforeEach(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback before each Scenario starts executing.

```javascript
suite.beforeEach((scenario) => {});
```

### buildUrl(path: string): string

Creates a fully qualified URL based on the input string. This will be relative to the Suite's base.

```javascript
suite.buildUrl("/index.html");
```

### catch(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after the Suite completes if there is an error or failure in any Scenario.

```javascript
suite.catch(() => {});
```

### execute(): Suite

If this scenario was told to wait() to execute, this will set them all to no longer wait. If the scenario has everything it needs, it will be queued up to execute.

```javascript
suite.execute();
```

### finally(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after all Scenarios finish executing and after the Suite has been marked completed. This is the final step.

```javascript
suite.finally(() => {});
```

### next(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after all Scenarios finish executing, but before Suite has been marked as completed. There can be multiple nexts.

```javascript
suite.next(() => {});
```

### print(exitAfterPrint: boolean = true): void

Prints the results from the test execution to the console. This is often run inside the finally callback. If you leave the default argument as true, the process will terminate after it prints. So be sure to set that to false if you don't want it to do so.

```javascript
suite.finally((suite) => suite.print(false));
```

### promise(): Promise\<Scenario\>

Promisifies the Suite. The returned promise will resolve once all scenarios in the suite complete successfully.

```javascript
try {
  await mySuite.promise();
  console.log("all scenarios in the suite completed successfully!");
} catch (ex) {
  console.log("uh oh! one or more scenarios failed!");
}
```

### resource(title: string, opts: any = {}): Scenario

Creates a new Scenario of the Generic Resource request type. This is any other random type of file. You can test the file size, mime type, content, HTTP status, etc.

```javascript
suite.resource("Make sure this file loads");
```

### setConcurrencyLimit(maxConccurentRequests: number): Scenario

Limit the number of scenario HTTP requests that can fire at a time. It will execute them in batches and wait for the response to continue the next one.

```javascript
suite.setConcurrencyLimit(10);
```

### scenario(title: string, type: string, opts?): Scenario

Creates a new scenario and adds it to the suite.

```javascript
suite.scenario("Load this HTML page", "html");
```

The allowed types for the second argument are:

#### atom

Validate your Atom feed. Will automatically apply assertions to do basic validation to Atom specifications.

#### browser

Creates a new Scenario of the Browser request type. This will run a version of Chrominium with Puppeteer.

```javascript
suite.scenario("User Sign Up Work Flow", "browser", {
  headless: true,
  width: 1280,
  height: 800,
});
```

#### extjs

Creates a new Scenario of the ExtJS request type. This will use Puppeteer just like the browser variety. The only difference is that it has Ext specific select methods and other helper methods to dig into this framework's custom internals.

```javascript
suite.extjs("User Sign Up Work Flow", {
  headless: true,
  width: 1280,
  height: 800,
});
```

#### ffprobe

Use ffprobe to validatate media source

#### headers

This will make a request only for the headers of a given URI. This is useful when you want to test that a file exists (or doesn't exist) but not need to download it. Think about a video file whose content you don't need to parse and the file size may be large.

```javascript
suite
  .scenario("Check if video file exists", "headers")
  .open("https://SOME/FILE/PATH.mp4")
  .next("Get headers", async (context) => {
    context.assert("File exists", context.response.statusCode).equals(200);
  });
```

#### hls

HLS media streams

#### html

Creates a new Scenario of the HTML/DOM Only request type. This will use Cheerio to grab the HTML and load it into a jQuery-like DOM that we can test against. We can fake a browser here, allowing form completion, clicks, etc. However, it just is not a full browser so does not have JavaScript and won't work on SPAs, unless they have server side rendering as well.

#### image

An image scenario will load only the first 512 bytes of the image, which includes the meta data that we need to assert things like height and width.

#### json

Creates a Scenario for REST API endpoints. Asserts that the response is valid JSON.

#### mediastreamvalidator

Validate HLS stream with Apple's mediastreamvalidator.

#### resource

Generic resource

#### rss

Validate your RSS feed. Will automatically apply assertions to do basic validation to RSS 2.0 specifications.

```javascript
suite.scenario("Make sure video loads", "video");
```

#### xml

Generic XML format.

### subscribe(callback: Function): void

Adds this callback to a PubSub subscription to get notified on any updates with the execute of thie Suite.

This will probably return a handle to be able to unsubscribe later, but it doesn't return anything yet.

```javascript
suite.callback((suite: Suite, status: SuiteStatusEvent) => {});
```

### success(callback: Function): Suite

Hit this callback after all Scenarios finish executing if all Scenarios passed. This happens following after and next, but before finally.

```javascript
suite.success(() => {});
```

### template(template(templateOptions: ScenarioInitOptions): Function

Often times we are generating scenarios that are almost duplicates of each other, with just one or two things different. This creates a lot of redundant code.

This method creates a generator function for you. You set the default options that all of the scenarios will inherit. Then use this generator function to create each scenario, changing whatever needs to be changed in the second argument.

```javascript
const get = suite.template({
  type: "html",
  method: "get",
  statusCode: 200,
});

get("Landing page", { url: "https://www.google.com/" });
get("Search results page", { url: "https://www.google.com/search?q=test" });
```

### verifySslCert(verify: boolean): Suite

Tells the request not to worry about verifying any SSL certs for HTTPS requests. This is helpful for local environments that may not have a valid cert. This value is passed on to any Scenarios created in this Suite, so you don't have to set it each time.

```javascript
suite.verifySslCert(false);
```

### wait(verify: boolean = true): Suite

Tells this suite not to execute right away. Will not execute any scenarios until .execute() is called. This wait value gets passed to any Scenarios created under this Suite, so that you don't have to set it each time.

```javascript
suite.wait();
```

## Properties

### baseUrl: string

The base URL tha tis being used to execute Scenarios in this Suite. It will come from the settings in the .base() method and what environment is selected.

### executionDuration: number | null

The amount of time, in milliseconds, between when the first Scenario in the Suite started to execute and when the last one was completed.

### executionOptions: FlagpoleExecutionOptions

The execution options specified from the command line arguments or defaults. This notably includes environment.

```javascript
const baseDomain = suite.executionOptions.environment?.defaultDomain;
```

### title: string

The title of this suite, which is specified in the constructor.

### totalDuration: number | null

The total amount of time, in milliseconds, between when the Suite was initialized and when it was completed.
