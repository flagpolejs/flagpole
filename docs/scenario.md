# Scenario

A scenario is a collection of tests. It is a child of a Suite.

## Methods

### after(callback: Function): Scenario

This will be called immediately after the scenario completes execution. You can set more than one and they will be called in the order that they were set.

If this callback returns a promise, further callbacks are delayed until the promise resolves.

The first argument to the callback is the scenario itself.

```typescript
scenario.after((scenario: Scenario) => {
  console.log(`${scenario.title} has completed`);
});
```

### before(callback: Function): Scenario

This will be called immediately before the scenario executes the request. You can set more than one and they will be called in the order that they were set.

If this callback returns a promise, execution is delayed until the promise resolves.

The first argument to the callback is the scenario itself.

```typescript
scenario.before((scenario: Scenario) => {
  scenario.setBearerToken(token);
});
```

### comment(message: string)

Write a comment line to the output log.

### execute(): Promise\<Scenario\>

A scenario will automatically execute, unless told otherwise by the `.wait()` method, once it has the necessary properties set to do so. Namely, it must know the URL to open (with the `.open(...)` method) and have at least one `.next()` block to run tests against.

```typescript
scenario2.execute();
```

If the `open` method was called with URL parameters in it like this:

```typescript
myScenario.open("POST /events/{eventId}");
```

That is NOT enough information to execute the scenario (since we don't yet have the value of that parameter). Flagpole will consider this an "implicit wait", so you don't have to separately call the `.wait()` method to tell it to hold off.

So now that you have this scenario waiting on parameters, you will call the `execute` method with those parameters in an object like this:

```typescript
myScenario.execute({
  eventId: 53322,
});
```

### failure(callback: Function): Scenario

Assign a callback that will be hit whenever the scenario completes with at least one failed assertion. You can set more than one of these callbacks, which will be called in the order they are set.

```typescript
scenario.failure((scenario: Scenario) => {
  console.log(":-(");
});
```

Additionally you can return a promise. Execution will be delayed until the promise is resolved.

```typescript
scenario.failure((scenario: Scenario) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log(
      "I am sad that we failed an assertion, so I will delay further execution one second."
    );
    setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
  });
});
```

### finally(callback: Function): Scenario

This will be called after everything else has been called. This is the last hoorah of the scenario. It will be called regardless of pass, failure, or error. Multiple finally callbacks can be set and they will execute in the order set.

```typescript
scenario.finally((scenario: Scenario) => {
  console.log(scenario.hasPassed ? ":-)" : ":-(");
});
```

### get(aliasName: string): any

If a value was previously saved on this Scenario `set` or within an Assertion, Value or DOMElement with `as` then use this `get` method to retrieve it.

```javascript
console.log(scenario.get("foo"));
```

### getLog(): Promise\<iLogLine[]\>

Return the logs from each line of the test, including passes, fails, and comments.

### local(filePath: string): Scenario

This allows you to run the tests against a local file, rather than an HTTP request. Pass in the full path to the file. The scenario will attempted to read that file and run the scenario's tests against it.

```javascript
suite
  .scenario("Test local file", "json")
  .local("/usr/jason/example.json")
  .next(async (context) => {
    await context.exists("message");
  });
```

### logResult(result: AssertionResult)

Write a result line to the output log.

### logWarning(message: string): Scenario

Write a non-fatal warning line to the output log.

### mock(body: string): Scenario

This allows you to run a scenario of tests against a manually input response body, rather than an HTTP request.

```typescript
suite
  .scenario("Test manual input", "resource")
  .mock("OK")
  .next((context) => {
    context.assert(context.response.body).equals("OK");
  });
```

With this method of passing in a string, it will just be treated like a 200 response. However, you can pass in a full mocked up request if you prefer...

### mock(response: ResponseOptions): Scenario

Use this to mock up the entire reponse:

```typescript
suite
  .scenario("Test against this mocked up response", "json")
  .mock({
    body: {
      foo: "bar",
    },
    status: [200, "OK"],
  })
  .next(async (context) => {
    const foo = await context.exists("foo");
    context.assert(foo).equals("bar");
  });
```

Here are the properties you can optionally pass in as options:

- body: any;
- status: [number, string];
- headers: KeyValue;
- cookies: KeyValue;
- trailers: KeyValue;
- method: string;
- url: string;

### next(): Scenario

These callbacks will contain the assertions and other parts of the scenario we want to execute. Next can be chained to group the scenario into logical sections. The method has two overload possibilities:

#### next(message: string, callback: any): Scenario

```javascript
scenario.next("Fill out the form", async (context) => {
  const form = await context.find("form");
  await form.fillForm({
    q: "Flagpole JS QA",
  });
});
```

#### next(callback: any): Scenario

```javascript
scenario.next(async (context) => {
  const form = await context.find("form");
  await form.fillForm({
    q: "Flagpole JS QA",
  });
});
```

### open(url: string): Scenario

Set the URL that the scenario should open. If at least one next callback has already been set, this will cause the scenario to start executing (unless you have set it to wait). Typically this is a relative URL, which will be built based on the suite's base.

```javascript
scenario.open("/api/articles");
```

Optionally, you can pass the HTTP verb in as a prefix. If you do so, it should be all capital letters followed by a space and then the URL. For example:

```javascript
scenario.open("POST /api/articles");
```

You can also include URL parameters in the path. Surround these by brackets like `{eventId}`. Doing so will allow you to define the template of the URL of the scenario, while not executing it right away. This will be interpetted as if we called the `.wait()` method on the scenario or what we will call an "implicit wait." The scenario will not start until we provide those URL parameters with the `execute` command, like so:

```typescript
scenario.open("POST /api/articles/{articleId}");
scenario.execute({
  articleId: 32423,
});
```

#### open(url: string, requestOpts: HttpRequestOptions): Scenario

You can pass an object of request options as the second argument, which can be a really convenient way to set some parameters.

```typescript
scenario.open("POST /api/articles/{articleId}", {
  headers: {
    "X-My-Header": "value",
  },
  cookies: {
    token: "ASDFASDFASDF1123",
  },
  data: {
    name: "Jason",
  },
});
```

### pause(milliseconds: number): Scenario

Insert a `next` callback that pauses for this amount of time.

```javascript
scenario
  .next((context) => {
    context.assert(true).equals(true);
  })
  .pause(3000)
  .next((context) => {
    context.assert(true).equals(true);
  });
```

### promise(): Promise\<Scenario\>

Promisifies the Scenario. The returned promise will resolve once the scenario completes successfully.

Here is an example where `myScenario` was waiting to excecute. We tell it to execute and return a promise. Now we can await it and the line after will not run until it has completed successfully.

```javascript
try {
  await myScenario.execute().promise();
  console.log("scenario completed successfully");
} catch (ex) {
  console.log("uh oh! scenario failed!");
}
```

### server(): Promise\<WebhookServer\>

If you read the `webhook()` documentation here, there is a bit of gap. You can use that method to set up a local HTTP server to wait for an incoming request before kicking off a test scenario. However, you can have that `webhook` method pick your port for you, and that happens asynchronously. So how will you know the resulting port?

```javascript
const server = await suite
  .scenario("Test Webhook", "json")
  .webhook()
  .next(async (context) => {})
  .server();
```

By using the `server()` method (and waiting the result of the promise), you will get those details. The result will give you the following properties:

- port: number
- opts: ServerOptions
- server: Minikin.server [https://github.com/jasonbyrne/minikin]

So then you will be able to proceed with setting up your ngrok URL or whatever you need to set the callback.

```javascript
const webhookUrl = await ngrok.connect(server.port);
```

### set(aliasName: string, value: any): Scenario

Save `value` to alias `aliasName` so it that it can be retrieved later with a `.get(aliasName)` call.

```javascript
scenario
  .before((scenario) => {
    scenario.set("foo", "bar");
  })
  .next((context) => {
    context.assert(context.get("foo")).equals("bar");
  });
```

### setBasicAuth(authorization: { username: string, password: string }): Scenario

Set basic authentication schema for sites that expect this old fashioned auth strategy.

```javascript
scenario.setBasicAuth({
  username: "john_doe",
  password: "abc123",
});
```

### setBearerToken(token: string): Scenario

Many APIs are starting to use the bearer token method of authentication. This will set the header accordingly.

```javascript
scenario.setBearerToken(jwtToken);
```

### setCookie(key: string, value: string, opts?: any): Scenario

Set a cookie with a key and value. The opts allow you to set additional options like domain and ttl.

Options supports these properties, in line with the ToughCookie format.

- expires - Date - if set, the Expires= attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string "Infinity"). See setExpires()
- maxAge - seconds - if set, the Max-Age= attribute in seconds of the cookie. May also be set to strings "Infinity" and "-Infinity" for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively. See setMaxAge()
- domain - string - the Domain= attribute of the cookie
- path - string - the Path= of the cookie
- secure - boolean - the Secure cookie flag
- httpOnly - boolean - the HttpOnly cookie flag
- extensions - Array - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)
- creation - Date - when this cookie was constructed
- creationIndex - number - set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (please see cookieCompare(a,b) for a full explanation)

### setFormData(form: {}): Scenario

When you want to simulate a form submission, pass in those values here. It expects an object, which will be serialized automatically in this method.

```javascript
scenario.setFormData({
  firstName: "George",
  lastName: "Brett",
});
```

### setHeader(key: string, value: any): Scenario

Set a single header.

```javascript
scenario.setHeader("jwt_token", "your-token-here");
```

### setHeaders(headers: {}): Scenario

Allows you to set multiple headers at once with a key-value object. This does not remove existing headers, it overlays on top of the existing headers that have been set.

```javascript
scenario.setHeader({
    'jwt_token', 'your-token-here',
    'jwt_refresh', 'your-refresh-token-here'
})
```

### setJsonBody(jsonObject: any): Scenario

Sets the JSON Body that will be submitted with the request. This can only be called before the scenario has executed. This is the same thing as setRawBody, except that it accepts an object that will be stringified through this method.

```javascript
scenario.setJsonBody({
  athlete: {
    firstName: "Jose",
    lastName: "Canseco",
  },
});
```

### setMaxRedirects(n: number): Scenario

Sometimes tests can get stuck in a redirect loop. This limits how many times to allow redirects... or prevents it from following any at all (if you set it to 0).

```javascript
scenario.setMaxRedirects(1);
```

### setMethod(method: string): Scenario

Set the HTTP Method of the request. This can accept any value but typically it would be one the following:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE
- PATCH
- OPTIONS

Alternately, you can set the HTTP verb/method as part of the `open` method.

### setProxyUrl(proxyUrl: string): Scenario

If your network requires you to proxy the request through another URL, set that here.

### setRawBody(str: string): Scenario

Sets the raw post body that will be submitted with the request. This can only be run before the scenario has executed.

```javascript
scenario.setRawBody("what up");
```

### setTimeout(timeout: number): Scenario

Set the request timeout for how long to wait for a response.

### skip(message?: string): Promise\<Scenario\>

Sometimes, perhaps based on the results from a previous scenario in the suite, we want to skip a certain scenario. All scenarios must be completed in one way or another, in order for the parent suite to complete. So if we determine that a certain scenario should not run, we use skip. It will appear in the output as skipped and will not count as failed or passed.

```javascript
scenario.skip(
  "There were no images on the page, so we skipped the image validation scenario."
);
```

### subheading(message: string)

Write a subheading element to the output log.

### subscribe(callback: Function)

Subscribes to updates to the status of this scenario.

```
scenario2.subscribe((scenario: Scenario, status: ScenarioStatusEvent) => {
  console.log(`${scenario.title} changed to ${status}`);
})
```

Possible values of the status argument enum:

- beforeExecute
- executionProgress
- afterExecute
- finished

### success(callback: Function): Scenario

This callback will be hit after the scenario completes, if all of the assertions pass. You can set more than one of these callbacks and they'll be called in the order they were set.

The this context will be the current scenario, but if you do an arrow function you'll need to use the argument.

```javascript
scenario.success((scenario: Scenario) => {
  console.log("PASSED!!");
});
```

Additionally you can return a promise. Execution will be delayed until the promise is resolved.

### verifySslCert(verify: boolean): Scenario

By default the request will verify a valid SSL certificate if the URL is set to https protocol. Sometimes we don't want this to happen, like when we're running against a local environment that doesn't have an actual SSL certificate. Pass in false to this method to disable this check.

```javascript
scenario.verifySslCert(false);
```

### wait(bool: boolean = true): Scenario

Sometimes you may NOT want to execute a scenario until you specifically say so. By setting this argument to true, the scenario will not run until you call the execute method--even once you set a next callback and open URL. Default argument is true.

```javascript
scenario.wait();
```

### waitFor(thatScenario: Scenario): Scenario

Sometimes you may NOT want to execute a scenario until another scenario has successfully completed. For example, if `scenario1` does a PUT request on an API and `scenario2` does a GET to verify that it was set correctly... you want to make sure that `scenario2` waits for a successfully completed `scenario1`. This method provides that convenient shorthand.

```javascript
scenario2.waitFor(scenario1);
```

### waitForFinished(): Promise\<void\>;

Wait for this scenario to complete, either success or failure.

```javascript
await scenario.waitForFinished();
```

### waitForResponse(): Promise\<void\>;

Wait for the response to come back from the scenario's HTTP request.

```javascript
await scenario.waitForResponse();
```

### webhook(): Scenario

Instead of making an HTTP request and testing the resposne, this allows you instead to wait for an incoming request. It will dynamically create a local web server that will receive the incoming request and pass it into the scenario to run tests against that resquest, as if it were a response.

It can accept from zero to three arguments. Those arguments, in order, are:

- route: string
- port: number
- opts: https.ServerOptions

Any or all of these arguments can be skipped. If you do not pass in the route argument, it will be set to wildcard. If you do not pass in a port number, it will try to find a port for you. And if you do not pass in ServerOptions, it will just use the default.

Here is an example usage:

```javascript
await suite
  .scenario("Test Webhook", "json")
  .webhook("POST /myCallback", 8001)
  .next(async (context) => {
    const message = await context.exists("message");
    context.assert(message).equals("OK");
  });
```

The above will start an HTTP server on `localhost:8001`. The tests in `next` will not run until that incoming POST request is received. If you then make a POST to `http://localhost:8001/myCallback` with `{ "message": "OK" }` you will see the test run and report success.

The main idea with this is that you can use this to wait for a response from an API that will hit a webhook callback, to make sure the whole thing completes end-to-end. If you're running this test locally against a public API, however, the API can clearly not reach your localhost. That's where a service like ngrok would come in, so you could do something like this:

```javascript
const webhookUrl = await ngrok.connect(8001);
```

This would give you a public-facing URL for your `locahost:8001`. Then you could pass the resulting URL into your API as the callback URL.

Okay, great, but if you do not set the port number, how will you know how to address it? Great question! See the `server()` method documentation.

## Properties

Most of these properties are read only. You can not set any of them directly, unless otherwise designated.

### canExecute: boolean

Indicates whether this scenario can potentially execute. A scenario can only execute once, so if it has already excuted this will be false. Additionally a scenario requires both a URL to open (via the open method) and at least one next callback (set with the next method).

### executionDuration: number | null

The total time between when the Scenario was started executing and when it finished running. Null if it has not yet completed.

### finalUrl: string | null

Get the final URL of the response after all redirects.

### hasExecuted: boolean

Has this scenario already started executing?

### hasFailed: boolean

Did this Suite (or any of its Scenarios) fail? If the Suite is not yet completed (or hasn't started yet) this will be false, unless any Scenario has already failed.

### hasFinished: boolean

Has this scenario already finished executing?

### hasPassed: boolean

Did this Suite (and all of its Scenarios) complete and all were passing?

suite.hasPassed

### requestOptions(): any

Get the options that we have set for the request. This will include cookies, headers, JSON Body, and anything else that we set.

### responseDuration: number | null

The total time between when the Scenario's request went out and when the response back back. Null if it the request has not yet returned a response.

### responseType: ScenarioType

The type of Scenario this is, the type of request we'll make and the response we'll expect back.

_Possible Values: html, json, image, script, video, audio, resource, browser, extjs_

### title: string

Title of the Scenario as it will be printed on reports. This is both a getter and a setter.

### totalDuration: number | null

The total time between when the Scenario was initialized and when it finished running. Null if it has not yet completed.

### url: string | null

Get the original URL of the request. This will be an absolute URL, derived from the path set in the open method and the suite's base.
