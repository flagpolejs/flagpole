### Developer Style Guide

- Class is ordered: public properties, private/protected properties, constructor, public methods, private/protected methods
- Private/protected properties and methods are prefixed with \_
- Camel-case all the things, except class names and enums
- Interfaces are prefixed by i
- Think about the developer experience of the person writing the tests first and foremost
- Definitively type whenever possible
- Favor readability over cleverness or brevity
- Document and comment liberally
- Don't try to do everything, but do the common QA functions really well
- As much as possible, create a common experience across different classes of scenarios
- Keep the framework as light as possible, which might mean auto-discovery and dynamically loading optional libraries
- It should be obvious, it should not mislead or confuse or cause additional cognitive load
- Do what you say, say what you do. No side effects.
- Try to start methods with verbs unless it's just really short, sweet, and obvious not to
- Start properties or methods that return booleans with "is" or "has" or "can" or something similar that reads what it is
- Start methods that convert an object to a different type with "to" like "toArray"
- Some things are designed to be chained, such as setting up a Suite or Scenario, so allow this to be chained by returning themselves, but don't chain just for the sake of chaining. Chain of readability and convenience of DX only.
